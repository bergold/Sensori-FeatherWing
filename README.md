# Sensorimotor FeatherWing

This FeatherWing lets you connect your Feather to a RS-485 bus. It also provides various ways of providing power to your RS-485 bus system, as well as the ability to back-power the Feather from the bus.

The bus connector is compatible to the Sensorimotor system. (It's a 4-pin Molex Mini-SPOX)
